# 1. Create a dictionary (hash) with 10 city names, where the city name (key) will be a string, and the area code would be the value, an example is given in the resources in the project video

# 2. Display the city names to the user for cities which are available in the dictionary

# 3. Get input from the user on the city name (hint: use gets.chomp method)

# 4. Display area code based on user's city choice

# 5. Loop - keep the program running and prompt the user for new city names to lookup

# 6. Complete the two methods to lookup city names and to find area code based on city names
